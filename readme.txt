Each piece of music has 1 or 2 associated text files, since one or two listeners annotated each piece (in the rare case of piece #78, there are 3 files, to indicate a 3-layer annotation by one listener). The files are all labelled "textfile1.txt" and "textfile2.txt" and organized in directories by their unique SONG_ID.

Brief metadata for the pieces of music used are given in a CSV spreadsheet. The fields are, in order:
SONG_ID, SOURCE, ANNOTATOR1, ANNOTATOR2, SONG_DURATION, SONG_TITLE, ARTIST, ANNOTATION_TIME1, ANNOTATION_TIME2, TEXTFILE1, TEXTFILE2, CLASS, GENRE, SUBMISSION_DATE1, SUBMISSION_DATE2, PRIVACY, XEQS1, XEQS2

The fields indicate:
SONG_ID                   Unique identifier for piece of music
SOURCE                    Either Codaich, IA (Internet Archive), or RWC
ANNOTATOR1                ID number for first annotator
ANNOTATOR2                ID number for second annotator
SONG_DURATION             Duration of the piece, in seconds
SONG_TITLE                Title
ARTIST                    Artist
ANNOTATION_TIME1          Self-reported time to complete annotation for first annotator
ANNOTATION_TIME2          Self-reported time to complete annotation for second annotator
TEXTFILE1                 File path for first annotator's file
TEXTFILE2                 File path for second annotator's file
CLASS                     Broad genre (classical, jazz, popular, world, Live_Music_Archive, or unknown)
GENRE                     Narrow genre
SUBMISSION_DATE1          Date of submission of first annotation
SUBMISSION_DATE2          Date of submission of second annotation
XEQS1                     Was the first annotation converted automatically from X/= notation? X indicates yes; 0 indicates no.
XEQS2                     Was the second annotation converted automatically from X/= notation? X indicates yes; 0 indicates no.

Annotations are provided as a single file in the format in which they were written. To understand how to parse this format, please look up the Annotator's Guide at salami.music.mcgill.ca.

New for version 1.2: parsed version of annotations.

A Ruby script was used to parse the annotations into separate files for the large-scale music similarity labels, small-scale music similarity labels, and function labels. The script which did the parsing is available on the SALAMI website but is not part of this package. Instrumentation labels are not yet included.

Note that the parsed annotations do not correct any errors in the annotations, which still exist where they may.

Note that some of the music for which we provide annotations was drawn from the RWC Popular, Classical, Jazz and Genre databases. Information on this music can be found in the following articles:
